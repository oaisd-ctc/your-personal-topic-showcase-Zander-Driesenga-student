            <h4>The History</h4>
            <p>The concept for the game was originated when Digital Extremes made a game called Dark Sector which DE used and took a lot of things from that game and put it in Warframe</p><br>
            <p>In the early days of Warframe each warframe had a skill tree that the player would have to unlock b playing the game but there was also an extended form of it that the players would have to purchase an in-game item that they could only get by purchasing it with real money.</p>
            <p>Many players did not like that because it was a bit pay to win and the developers took it out and pretty much voed to keep the game free to play and ever since you could get anything, even premium curancy, without spending any real money.</p><br>
            <p>On November 2013 the developers offered the game on steam to grow the player base because it was not getting noticed that much and they needed money to keep the game running and after few days they were getting enough money to keep the studio running.</p>
