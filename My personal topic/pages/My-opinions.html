        <h4>The comunity</h4>
        <article id="containing-box">
            <p>This is one of my favorite game because the comunity is in my eyes one of the most welcoming and friendly</p>
            <p>For example you can ask almost anybody in game or online and they will most likely answer and almost nobody is overly negative or toxic (though there are some outliers) which can't be said for other games (LoL, Valorant, CoD, etc)</p>
            <p>another thing is the developers who interact with the players, do dev streams and sometimes make changes based on what the players want</p>

        <h4>The gameplay</h4>
        <article id="containing-box">
            <p>I really like the gameplay of Warframe it is very fast paced but not to fast that I get overwhelmed</p> 
            <p>I love how I can make a loadout that can pretty much shread through enemies</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Warframe is a very grindy game that can sometimes take a while to get what you want and a lot of the time you might need the wiki to look at to know where to go to get thing you need</p>
