        <h4>The comunity</h4>
        <article id="containing-box">
            <p>This is one of my favorite game because the comunity is in my eyes one of the most welcoming and friendly</p>
            <p>For example you can ask almost anybody in game or online and they will most likely answer and almost nobody is overly negative or toxic (though there are some outliers) which can't be said for other games (LoL, Valorant, CoD, etc)</p>
            <p>another thing is the developers who interact with the players, do dev streams and sometimes make changes based on what the players want</p>
