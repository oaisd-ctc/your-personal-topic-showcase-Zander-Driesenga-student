            <h4>The comunity</h4>
            <div class="containing-box">
            <p>This is one of my favorite game because the comunity is in my eyes one of the most welcoming and friendly</p>
            <p>For example you can ask almost anybody in game or online and they will most likely answer and almost nobody is overly negative or toxic (though there are some outliers) which can't be said for other games (LoL, Valorant, CoD, etc)</p>
            <p>another thing is the developers who interact with the players, do dev streams and sometimes make changes based on what the players want</p>

        <h4>The gameplay</h4>
            <div class="containing-box">
            <p>I really like the gameplay of Warframe it is very fast paced but not to fast that I get overwhelmed</p> 
            <p>I love how I can make a loadout that can pretty much shread through enemies or make them explode</p>            
            <p>Warframe is a very grindy game that can sometimes take a while to get what you want and a lot of the time you might need the wiki to look at to know where to go to get thing you need</p>
            <p>Along with that it can take a bit to get to the start of the main story quests called "The Second Dream" and it gets better and better as you continue but is worth the grind</p>
            <p>The further you get into the game the more of a grind there is and I am a little scared because of how much I hear about the grind for a certain thing the I need to further progress the game</p>

            <h4>Final thoughts</h4>
        <div class="containing-box">
            <p>I have recantly gotten back into warframe which is why I am making the page about it and I am loving it, going through the starchart, makeing new weapons to try, more warframes to learn how to play them, and new builds to kill a lot faster</p>
            <p>I have been on and off this game many times for many different reasons but I think I will be sticking with it for a bit longer now now that I know what I am doing</p>
            <p>This is a great game with so much to do and even more on the way. A new expansion is comming soon and another called Warframe 1999 after that and I am exited to see and play it</p>
            <p>So, if you like a game with a bit of grind, pretty good story (the stuff before The Second Dream are not too conected but after is great), a great comunity, amazing devs that want to make an amazing game, and if you like to stealth the mission or kill masive amounts of enemies at once this is a great game to play</p>
